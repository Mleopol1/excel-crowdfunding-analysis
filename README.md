# Crowdfunding Analysis

This project involves organizing and analyzing a database of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to uncover any hidden trends and insights into what makes a successful crowdfunding campaign.

## Data

The dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC and is provided for educational purposes only. It includes information on 1,000 crowdfunding projects, such as their category, sub-category, funding goals, backers, and outcomes.

## Tasks

The project involves completing several tasks, including:

   * Using conditional formatting to color-code the outcome and percent funded columns
   * Creating new columns for percent funded, average donation, parent category, and sub-category
   * Creating pivot tables and stacked-column pivot charts to analyze the data by category and sub-category
   * Converting Unix timestamps to Excel's date format
   * Creating a pivot table and line graph to analyze outcomes based on launch date
   * Creating a report in Microsoft Word to answer questions about the data
